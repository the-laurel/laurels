# Tentative Volunteers Setup

3 steps:

- create accounts
- get your first Laurels
- monitor/propose additional tasks

Welcome to the tentative volunteers group.
This is where you get ready for any higher level, including sympathizer. Once you complete 3h of volunteering, your role will be upgraded to @sympathizer. You have 1 week. Success.

In the first 3 days, you are expected to complete Step 1 -> 3 and get your first laurels. If you need help with any of the steps, ask in this channel.

## Step 1 - Create the necessary Accounts
1. create a GitHub account: https://github.com/
2. install Metamask as a browser extension: https://metamask.io/download.html and create a wallet. We will only use a test network for The Laurel - currently Rinkeby. Choose one of the created Ethereum addresses (looks like 0x90F79bf6EB2c4f870365E785982E1f101E93b906) to use with The Laurel.
3. Add your information, that will appear publicly on our social media bots. Create a Pull Request with: 
  a) edit https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/blob/main/data/volunteersMap.json and add your chosen Ethereum address and your name or nickname.
  b) add an avatar here https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/tree/main/data/images. The file title must be your Ethereum address, like 0x90F79bf6EB2c4f870365E785982E1f101E93b906.png
If you do not know how to create a Pull Request: while logged into GitHub, click on the edit button from https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/blob/main/data/volunteersMap.json. This will fork the project on your account and you can start editing. Commit your changes to master. Upload your avatar. You will see a create Pull Request button under the "Contribute" dropdown - click on it.
4. get Rinkeby testnet ETH: https://faucet.rinkeby.io/
5. optionally follow https://twitter.com/provable_laurel, https://www.facebook.com/The-Laurel-Project-688583115349973 and create a https://www.reddit.com/ account if you don't have one yet.

## Step 2 - Get your first Laurels.
1. ask another volunteer to be your ancestor in the system and register you (provide your Ethereum address).
2. you will get 10 Marketing laurels (equivalent to 10 minutes of volunteer effort) when you are registered. This will help you claim your first task.
3. your first task can be: 
    a) retweet 5 tweets from @provable_laurel or another volunteer's tweets that are related to The Laurel and the technical projects developed under The Laurel (e.g. @lorecirstea).
    b) write a social media post (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit) saying what inspired you to join The Laurel and what your expectations are.
    c) you propose your own idea for a task that is compatible with the above
4. if your ancestor approves it, he/she will register this task for you in the system and give you the link for claiming. 
5. claim the task and you will be awarded with laurels.


## Step 3 - Search, Monitor or Propose Tasks. Then perform them. Repeat. You are part of The Laurel.
Search in https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/issues for other tasks, from any organizer.
If you do not find a task that you can do, ask in the channel.

## Aftermath
After the first week and/or accumulating the necessary Laurels for your level of involvement, you will have access to the corresponding repos and Discord channels.
