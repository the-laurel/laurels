# What is The Laurel?

The Laurel is: 
- a collection of game theory mechanisms*
- an Ethereum smart contract*
- a collection of currecies with its own market, separate from the for-profit market
- a collection of computing resources:
    - hardware, virtual hardware*
    - chat and social rooms for interaction and negotiation
    - better and more innovative software tools than those extant in the normal market*
- a collection of human resources: you can be assured that members adhere to more refined moral standards and principles. That they are willing to defend those principles and help other members in their efforts.
- (while the blockchain offers computability for the concept of trust) The Laurel is a theory and philosophy that offers a computable definition for concepts like: 
    - continous voting
    - quantized effort by type and quantity
    - eternal digital medal
    - generosity of 3 types*
    - prestige
    - proof of lack of corruption
    - proof of character
- a society that promotes smooth, continous evolution for every member and the society at large from the first level of generosity to the last and most refined level*
