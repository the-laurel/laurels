# First-Trial Tasks

Thank you for your interest in The Laurel Project. This project is a volunteer project that is different than most other projects because it maintains a high standard of transparency, adherence to ideals, and sincerity.

You may want to watch this YouTube playlist: [Introducing: The Laurel Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7-gIa6jiP0&list=PL323JufuD9JBzv9Spl6KcFMB631ZgcFPU).

Most people (thousands) who want to become volunteers here, do it because of our proven expertise with Blockchain tech. That is not a good reason for volunteering. Nor is wanting to learn for your sake. Learning you do in your spare time to have something to offer and is not accounted as giving (therefore it is not volunteering). This project accounts only for your giving to others - should you feel in your heart to do it.

Therefore we would propose to you some giving activities, so you will know if you sincerely feel like a volunteer when you perform them.

After performing them, fill in this feedback form https://forms.gle/GkHeXh3zRAnYrgQX8
We wish you success.

## - Video Lessons

Using slides from [The Laurel Project Branding](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L14FauAo4COkp8KjOFF7Wuh3TLRq_PBnX8ka0Qx36_w/edit#slide=id.g10a492d6bd2_0_10), make a video tutorial (2 to 5 minutes) in your area of expertise. Publish it unlisted on your Youtube account. Some examples: [Loredana's Videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/LoredanaCirstea/videos)

The first part of the video description text should read:

```

### Possible topics for your Video

- Ethereum, EVM, web3
- ReactJS
- Wasm
- Rust
- for anything else: ask in advance to determine if your topic is acceptable to the project.

The main purpose is to create a video useful for other people and especially for other volunteers.

### Format

You have artistic freedom. You can show your image using a webcam (ideally) or not. You can use your own voice (ideally) or a software-generated voice (if your English is not clear enough). You can show code examples and demos alongside the provided slides.
An example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZtGu9_rUHE
The first slide (from branding) should be the intro and the last the outro.
If the web browser is Chrome, you may use https://nighteye.app/ to obtain a dark background (better aligned to the style of most other videos).
