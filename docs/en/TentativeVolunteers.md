# Tentative Volunteers Setup

## Intro

@tentative volunteer: 
A short intro into how The Laurel works now for tasks and claiming.

As part of this introduction we'll go over setting up your accounts and getting you acquainted with the project. 

Please follow each step in order and reach out to defn(life()) if you have any questions. 

### Setup has 3 steps:

- create accounts
- earn your first Laurels
- monitor/propose additional tasks

This is where you get ready for any higher level, including sympathizer. >= 3h of volunteering, your role will be upgraded to @sympathizer. You have 1 week. Success.

In the first 2 days, complete Step 1 -> 3 and get your first laurels. If you need help with any of the steps, ask in this channel.

## Step 1 - Create the Necessary Accounts

-- If you have any issues please first see the Troubleshooting Section below--

1. create a GitHub account if you do not have one: <https://github.com/>
2. If you do not have a browser wallet for Ethereum: install Metamask extension: <https://metamask.io/download.html> and create a wallet. We only use a test network for The Laurel: Rinkeby. Choose one of the created Ethereum addresses (looks like `0x90F79bf6EB2c4f870365E785982E1f101E93b906`) to use with The Laurel.
3. The Rinkeby Network should be selected in your wallet. If you enter the Laurel DApp without having Rinkeby selected the DApp won't loand and you'll have to select it and refresh the page. 
4. In metamask you can change the network by: 
- a) just changing from the Ethereum Mainnet to the Rinkeby Test Network
- b) If the above doesn't appear you'll: click on your avatar > go into settings > Networks > and choose the Rinkeby Test Network.
5. Add your information, that will appear publicly on our social media bots. Create only 1 Pull Request with both changes: 
- a) edit <https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/blob/main/data/volunteersMap.json> and add your chosen Ethereum address and username.
- b) add a `png` avatar in <https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/tree/main/data/images> (< 500kB) in your repo. The file title must be your Ethereum address, like `0x90F79bf6EB2c4f870365E785982E1f101E93b906.png`
- *If you do not know how to create a Pull Request: while logged into GitHub, click on the edit button from <https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/blob/main/data/volunteersMap.json>. This will fork the project on your account and you can start editing. Commit your changes to a branch. Upload your avatar on that branch. You will see a create Pull Request button under the "Contribute" dropdown - click on it.*
- If using the Git command line is confusing, please just use the Github Desktop app. <https://desktop.github.com/>
6. get Rinkeby testnet ETH from <https://www.ethily.io/rinkeby-faucet>, <https://faucet.rinkeby.io/>, <https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby> or similar faucets.
7. optionally follow <https://twitter.com/provable_laurel>, <https://www.facebook.com/The-Laurel-Project-688583115349973> and create a <https://www.reddit.com/> account if you don't have one yet.

## Step 2 - Get your first Laurels.
1. ask another volunteer to be your ancestor in the system and register you (provide your Ethereum address).
2. you will get 10 Marketing laurels (equivalent to 10 minutes of volunteer effort) when you are registered. This will help you claim your first task.
3. your first task can be: 
- a) retweet 5 tweets from @provable_laurel or another volunteer's tweets that are related to The Laurel and the technical projects developed under The Laurel (e.g. @lorecirstea).
- b) write a social media post (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Linkedin) saying what inspired you to join The Laurel and what your expectations/hopes are. We expect it to be honest and factually correct.
- c) ask 5 questions about The Laurel Project and/or protocol, as comment to https://www.reddit.com/r/provable_laurel/comments/pt3opa/the_laurel_project_and_protocol_qa/ or other posts
- d) post a detailed first sight feedback: https://www.reddit.com/r/provable_laurel/comments/pt3vus/at_first_sight_no1/
- e) you propose your own idea for a task that is compatible with the above
4. if your ancestor approves it, he/she will register this task for you in the system and give you the link for claiming. 
5. claim the task and you will be awarded with laurels.

### Obtaining your first Laurels
Once you do one of the above tasks you'll get 10 marketing laurels (ML) that you can use to either claim a task rewarded with marketing laurels or create your own task, that someone else can claim. Or, you can claim it yourself, in order to start the dharma wheel.

At this time, we are awarding laurels on tasks that have been provably completed. People provide links to proof, or show proof through their commits to the network. Nobody claims laurels before the work is done (obviously).

If a task is worth 5 ML, then the organizer's balance is subtracted 5 ML and placed in escrow (to be retracted if the claim is challenged by other volunteers). 

The person who claims the task will also have 5 ML subtracted from his current balance. At the moment, 2* task amount is enough to award the claimer the reward in the same transaction. So, you will see the claimer's primordial balance increase.

To use this initial balance (they appear as PB in the table) also known as primordial balance, you need to pump! (transform it into a current balance). 

When you pump, your ancestor is rewarded and your balance is multiplied by (at the moment) a factor of 2. You click on the pump button and a prompt will appear in metamask to make a transaction. You accept and you'll see the change in balance once the transaction is confirmed.

A pump is both a claim to your current balance, and a reward to your ancestor for giving you a reward. The Laurel seeks to reward both Stakeholders (people awarding Laurels for tasks that are important to them) and Solvers (people who solve the tasks put forward by stakeholders).

Tasks are non-trivial. For Laurels to have any meaning they should always be to further the mission of the community. The Challenge system helps police against abuse by creating an incentive for all parties involved to maintain the integrity of the honor code.


## Step 3 - Search, Monitor or Propose Tasks. Then perform them. Repeat. You are part of The Laurel.
 The `laurels` repo is currently used for tasks that were already awarded.
See the #tasks channel for available tasks. Ask in their #tentative channel for guidance if you want to work on something that does not have enough information.

## Aftermath
After the first week and/or accumulating the necessary Laurels for your level of involvement, you will have access to the corresponding repos and Discord channels.

## Ongoing Work

You can see your earned laurels here: 
https://observablehq.com/@loredanacirstea/the-laurel-monitoring. This tool automatically looks at the last 7 days. @tentative volunteers need at least 180 Earned laurels in their first week, to pass to @sympathizer.

If you don't have enough laurels, check the tasks channel for what you can do. Announce your task and/or ask for clarification in the tentative channel.

If you have completed the Setup and don't have access to marks-factory-help , tell us. In marks-factory-help you can start by following the pinned messages and complete the first steps to learn how to use Marks Factory and create your first marks. It is expected of you to start exploring on your own and ask questions.

## Claiming a task:
1. Use the claim link from the monitor message announcing your task. (In the #monitor channel)
OR
2. Use The Laurel dApp - the link that you have received from your ancestor, when you were registered in the system. There is a TOC in the top-right menu that can help find the sections. Select your task at Choose task . Go to the Claim Task section. Make sure you are selected as the claim winner.

---- For both:----
- You need to be logged in (see the Login section at the top of the page)
- You need  have enough laurels (of the type used in the task) to claim. You may need to pump laurels, so they are transferred in your active balance - use the The Laurel dApp, # Pump section.
- Under URL(s) to your claim proofs, paste the link to your proof (e.g. PR links, video links, tweet links, etc.) 
- Click create proof URL (it leaves a comment from you, on the corresponding GitHub issue) -> you will be able to make the claim transaction by clicking on claimAndAward . 


## Troubleshooting The Laurel dApp. If you:
1. cannot see ANYTHING on the UI: tell us and we will give you another link. The main app is deployed on IPFS and peer-to-peer systems can have networking issues. We have a server-based backup.
2. cannot see any data in the app (e.g. tasks, balance table): Make sure you are connected to the Rinkeby network in Metamask. 
3. cannot see the balances table, but I see other data: Refresh the page.
4. cannot see a button to claim: make sure you are logged in to GitHub (see the Login section in the beginning).
